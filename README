registrars is a pomf clone/rewrite, written in Golang, powering
https://regist.ra.rs. It implements the pomf standard, including all
output types. No database is required to run registrars, nor are there
any special account features.

1 Build and run
===============

  After having had made sure that Go is installed, and having
  downloaded to code run "go build". This should produce a binary
  named "registrars".

  Make sure to execute the program within the directory with the other
  source code, since it needs the templates and other static files to
  run properly. Two directories will be created, if not already
  existing, to store uploads (`hdir' and `udir').

  Now the server should be running on port 8080, accessible by all
  addresses. To change this behaviour, specify an environmental
  variable "$HOST", eg.:

  ,----
  | HOST="192.168.2.107:9090" ./registrars
  `----
